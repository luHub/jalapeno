### Update 21/03/2017

Looks like Pepper project its migrating to use Android SDK, which was released
on March 2016. At this moment qChat for Android does not support Dutch Language,
because of this reason we deciced to use Choreograph 2.4. We did not use the last
version 2.5.5 because it stills under beta.

2)Project Requirements
----------------------

-Choreograph 2.4 (We avoid using beta for stability reasons) for Pepper.
To install Choreograph download the setup version from archives from

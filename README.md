Pepper Robot

1)Updates:

Update 21/03/2017:
Looks like Pepper project it migrating to use Android SDK, which was released
on March 2016. At this moment qChat fom Android does not support Dutch Language
because of this reason we deciced to use Choreograph 2.4. We did not use the last
version 2.5.5 because it is under beta.

2)Project Requirements:
---------------------
-Choreograph 2.4 (We avoid using beta for stability reasons) for Pepper.
To install Choreograph download the setup version from archives from
